  <h3 align= "center"> What is the Aiachy </h3>

<p align="center"> 
Aiachy is an innovative app available on iOS that invites users into a mystical world. Powered by artificial intelligence, the app provides in-depth interpretations of your zodiac sign, rising sign, and special chakras. But that's just the beginning; users can also listen to specially curated music to elevate their spirits and energies. You can delve into various forms of divination like tarot, palmistry, and crystal ball readings. Currently in beta, the app will soon introduce a dating feature that matches you based on your zodiac sign. Aiachy is not just an app; it's an experience that opens the doors to a mystical universe.

### Why VIPER Architectural ?

The VIPER architecture greatly facilitates the development of my iOS app. Thanks to this architecture, each component (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) has a specific role and responsibility, making the code much more readable and maintainable. Comments are placed above each function to clearly explain what the function does. This makes it easier for team members or even my future self to understand and work on the code. Additionally, the content within the app is highly organized. Each module contains only the functionality it is responsible for, making navigation and debugging within the app much more comfortable. VIPER is not just an architecture; it's also an investment in making the project long-lasting and sustainable.

### Aiachy Design: Where Mystical Experience Meets Technology

Utilizing the Figma platform, I crafted an interface that is not only aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly but also creates a mystical atmosphere, thanks to vector designs and UI/UX principles. Each element was carefully chosen and placed to offer the user not just an app but a visionary experience that looks towards the future. The user will feel as if they are living in a mystical world, rather than just using a conventional app. Throughout each stage of the design process, the needs and expectations of the users were taken into consideration. The end result is an app design that appeals to both the eye and the soul, without causing any issues for the user. Technical features like responsive design and cross-platform compatibility were also incorporated, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

Aiachy app now available via [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aiachy/id6463338494?uo=2).
